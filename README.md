"Trailblazers don't simply tread new ground, though, of course they do that. 

What trailblazers do is show us that it is possible to do the undoable, that it is possible to see the un-see-able and that it is possible to be the unbelievable. 

What trailblazers do is make the first ascent with all its inherent risk, all its inevitable stumbles, all its requisite exploration.

What trailblazers do is draw better maps. And when they are done, they come down from the mountain knowing the next generation of climbers have already begun their treks. 

They come down knowing that those who are closer to the base than the peak get to carry in their packs the priceless maps that have been drawn for them with the deepest of breaths."
